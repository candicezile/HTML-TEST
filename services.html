<h2>Technology Matters</h2>
<p>My Website's technology infrastructure and data structures allow insight into parcel level stock in transit, value of stock in transit, specific images and custom data captured at parcel level, electronic proof of delivery with sign on glass enablement as well as specific service level instructions.

My Website Fashion Services was one of the first in the industry to integrate systems with clients to obtain parcel (consignment) data and to allow parcel tracking and tracing to the point of delivery.

Delivery confirmation (POD) is facilitated by the use of personal digital assistant (PDA), allowing instantaneous confirmation of deliveries and ability to verify actual receipts vs expected receipts.

Our business intelligent systems ensure our clients have full visibility across our operations providing real time information throughout the supply chain. The richness and granularity of this data, interpreted with industry experience, affords our clients a real insight into operations and a market advantage.</p>
